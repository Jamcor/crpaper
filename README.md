SUMMARY

This repository contains code and data in support of the competing risks (CR) paper titled 'Quantifying intrinsic and extrinsic control of cell fates in stem/progenitor cell pedigrees with competing risks analysis'. This was submitted to Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on 07/07/2015. 

Data are provided as .txt files that contain cell lifetime data (i.e. including clone number, progeny ID, generation number, kinship, fate outcome, time of fate outcome, genotype, treatment condition, and measurement of fluorescent reporters). 

Code is provided as .R files. There is one .R file for each data set. Each .R file contains all analysis presented in the cr paper for each data set.  

SECTION 1 - BCC DATA AND ANALYSIS

BCC data are 'BCC data.txt' and is contained in 'CR paper repository/BCC analysis'
Code for analysis of BCC data is 'Code for analysis of BCC data.R' and is contained in 'CR paper repository/BCC analysis'

This code will load the relevant data sets and perform all analysis of BCC lifetime data presented in the CR paper.

SECTION 2 - GMP DATA AND ANALYSIS

GMP data are 'GMPCrossOdds.txt', 'GMPDivisionCrossOdds.txt', and 'GMPregression.txt'  and are contained in 'CR paper repository/GMP analysis'
Code for analysis of GMP data is 'Code for analysis of GMP data.R' and is contained in 'CR paper repository/GMP analysis'

This code will load the relevant data sets and perform all analysis of GMP lifetime data presented in the CR paper.


SECTION 3 - CCFU-F DATA AND ANALYSIS

cCFU-F data is 'cCFU-F data.txt' and is contained in 'CR paper repository/cCFU-F analysis'
Code for analysis of cCFU-F data is 'Code for analysis of cCFU-F data.R' and is contained in 'CR paper repository/BCC analysis'

This code will load the relevant data sets and perform all analysis of cCFU-F lifetime data presented in the CR paper.
